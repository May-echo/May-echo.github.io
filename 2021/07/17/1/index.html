        <p>A very important time for me was the latter half of 2019 when I went to Cambridge in the UK. For a junior high school student, this place is fantastic. I decided to accept further education at international high school in our country, so I could pursue higher education in the UK. In order to achieve this goal, I had to study hard and do well in <em>senior high school entrance examination</em> one year later.    </p>
<p>During my preparation, I asked my English teacher for help, because she used to be an overseas student in the UK. As her course subject representative, I personally believed that she could give me some useful suggestions on my decision. As expected, she appreciated my courage and told me that passion comes first , and I should follow my heart to have a try. Furthermore, from my outstanding behavior at school, she agreed that I have developed strong leadership skills and was good at organizing my tasks, which include managing the whole class and classifying data. It was the reason that she provided me the enough encouragement to apply for International Department of <em>JIN LING high school</em>, and I felt that she was my source of confidence.      </p>
<p>As the entrance examination would test 7 different subjects, I tried my best to manage my finite time. Therefore, I judged my subjects on whether they were problematic or not, and allocated my time depending on my understanding stage. If it was the subject that I was poor at, I devoted  more time to review knowledge, instead of doing past papers. In contrast, if it was a subject that I did well in, such as Ethics and the Rule of Law, I preferred to practice my problem-solving skills. Then, I had achieved my original aspiration of studying in JIN LING high school. In addition, I further analyzed about the significance of applying to overseas universities in Britain. Overall, I think that current education system in our country is too focused on science and engineering education, which has petrified my thinking and ignores my sociological interest. I have a dream to embrace a bigger world. Even if it will be a challenge to study abroad, I am willing to devote my efforts to the field I loved.    </p>
